		<h3>Online Registration</h3>
		<p>Maintain your registration process 24/7 by encouraging busy parents to enroll their children online. Parents who have to go out of their way to enroll, or print and mail documents for registration, will be less inclined to register with your camp; they'll look for one with convenient online registration.</p>

		<p>How many times have you had to mail or phone a parent to remind them of an outstanding payment? AllPlayers.com takes that off your plate and enables instant credit card payment online at the time of registration. Of course, you can still collect fees in-house, or enable registration without payment for individuals.</p>

		<p>Make it easy for your campers to afford and pay for your camp. AllPlayers.com gives you the option of setting up installment payment plans for your campers.</p>
		<p>Group administrators can define payment plans, including first and final payment dates, enabling participants to pay gradually over a defined time period.

		<h3>Paperwork reduction</h3>
		<p>
		Repetitive paperwork is a drag. Ask any parent who enrolls their children in more than one camp or activity and they'll all tell you they wish there was an easier way! With AllPlayers.com, you have the answer they want.</p>

		<p>Parents can complete registration documents online, sign waivers, read handbooks and agree to camp rules all online at their convenience. And the best thing? They only have to do it once per child! As long as the camper's information doesn't change, the same paperwork is stored for your records.</p>

		<h3>Bring the camp home</h3>

		<p>Create photo albums so parents can view photos from last week's field trip. Parents can comment on activities, contact the counselors/leaders and become more active and knowledgeable in their children's daily routines.</p>
