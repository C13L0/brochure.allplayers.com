		<p>
			AllPlayers class system is based off of <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/v/3.2.5/components.php">Foundation 3.2.5</a>, a compass plugin that uses SASS. In order to view all of the classes you need to use in order to format elements, blocks and pages please visit <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/v/3.2.5/components.php">HERE</a>. Here you can also find code examples of what you need to theme your next AllPlayers related project and make it look consistant with AllPlayers styles.

		<img src="images/branding/compass-logo.png" />
		<p>
			<a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> is an open-source CSS Authoring Framework. In addition to allowing you to write SASS (and generate CSS) it also has many built in functions that makes CSS generation fast and easy. Please look at <a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/">the reference doc</a> to view what types of built-in <strong>mixins</strong> and <strong>helpers</strong> can make your CSS generation experience faster and more efficient.
		</p>
		<span>In order to compile CSS while you are writing SCSS simply type: <pre class="highlight plaintext" style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom: 3px;">$ compass watch</pre> into the command-line inside the project folder.</span>
  	<span>If there is a merge conflict in a css file it is best practice to run <pre class="highlight plaintext" style="display:inline-block;">$ compass clean; compass compile; </pre> in order to remove and recompile the CSS.</span>

  	<h5>The Importance of the Gem Bundler</h5>

  	<p><a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a></p>
  	<p>Inside of the Basic Foundation theme file there is a Ruby Gem bundle that installs all the necessary gems <em>(AND NECESSARY VERSIONS OF GEMS)</em> that you need to get started with theming in SASS.</p>

  	<span>Simply type <pre class="highlight plaintext" style="display:inline;">$ bundle install</pre> into the command-line while you are inside of the basic_foundation folder and all of the necessary gems will be installed. </span>

  	<h5>Jekyll</h5>
  	<p>All of our brochure sites (including this one) are built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll.</a></p>

  	<span>Simply type <pre class="highlight plaintext" style="display:inline;">$ jekyll serve -w</pre> into the command-line while you are inside the project folder in order to compile and serve your files on the localhost. Read more about Jekyll <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">here</a>.</span>
