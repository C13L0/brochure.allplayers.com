<p>While we all recognize that we cannot efficiently run our events and organizations without volunteers, the old adage “a bad volunteer is better than no volunteer” is simply too dangerous. Failing to take actions to screen coaches and volunteers places organizations and participants at risk. It is recommended by most associations that volunteers be considered with the same scrutiny as paid staff and held to the same screening processes, because in most cases the law does not distinguish between paid or volunteer personnel.

<p>With the different levels of screening offered by our industry-leading partners, you can request reports be as in-depth as you need. From simple civil record checks to database searches through county records, correctional facilities, courts, and state sex offender registries covering 49 states, Washington DC, Guam and Puerto Rico - you’re bound to find the option that satisfies your requirements.</p>
