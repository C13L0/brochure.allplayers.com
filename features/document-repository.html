<p>Every organization has information they need to distribute to their members – consent forms, liability waivers, rule books and more, for each enrollment period. We simplify this process for everyone – and save you time and money – by allowing organizations to file and store documents within group pages.</p>
<p> Reduce form fatigue by only asking your members for information one time, then store it safely and securely in your AllPlayers.com data silo.  Proven priceless, this storage system enables members to quickly and efficiently register for repetitive groups, teams, leagues, camps, classes and more without having to re-enter their personal information over and over each session. Moreover, this allows managers to have quick and accurate information at their fingertips, 24/7!</p>
