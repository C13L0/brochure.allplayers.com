<p>Let’s face it - some people just simply lose things. So let’s help them out: upload the files that you normally print, email, hand out, collect and store to AllPlayers.com file server.</p>

<p>Uploading files to our document server allows your group members to download them whenever they need to. This allows you to distribute all the relevant and important information to guardians, team members, students, etc...all without having to print, distribute, and collect them back. </p>
	
<p>Files can include liability waiver notices, classroom rules, class syllabus, league rules, field trip permission notes - anything you would normally handout or email repeatedly can easily be made available 24/7.
