<p>Some people lose things, most kids leave their handouts behind, and a lot of parents misplace their paperwork, so letâ€™s help them out.  Upload the files that you normally print, email, hand out, collect and store to AllPlayers.com file server. Make it easier for everyone by uploading files to our document server and allow your group members to download them when needed.</p>

<p>Files can include liability waiver notices, classroom rules, class syllabus, league rules, field trip permission notes - anything you would normally handout or email repeatedly can easily be made available 24/7. </p>
