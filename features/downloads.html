<p>Let’s face it - most kids leave their handouts behind, a lot of parents misplace their paperwork, and some people just simply lose things. So let’s help them out: upload the files that you normally print, email, hand out, collect and store to AllPlayers.com file server. </p>

<p>Uploading files to our document server allows your group members to download them whenever they need them. This allows you to distribute all the relevant and important information to guardians, team members, students, etc...all without having to worry about the cost of printing, whether you have enough for everyone, or if the paper is even getting brought home. 
</p>

<p>Files can include liability waiver notices, classroom rules, class syllabus, league rules, field trip permission notes - anything you would normally handout or email repeatedly can easily be made available 24/7.
