<p>Every organization has information they need to distribute to their members – consent forms, liability waivers, rule books and more, for each enrollment period. We simplify this process for everyone – and save you time and money – by allowing organizations to file and store documents within group pages.</p>
<p>Uploading files to our document server allows your group members to download them whenever they need to. This allows you to distribute all the relevant and important information to guardians, team members, students, etc...all without having to print, distribute, and collect them back. Anything you would normally handout or email repeatedly can easily be made available 24/7.</p>
