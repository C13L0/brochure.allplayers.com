		<h3>Registration available 24/7 </h3>
		<p>Parents have busy schedules, they can’t always get in to a facility to fill out paperwork or write a check. Take away that sense of dread of having to skip their lunch break to stand in line to register their kids by sending them a link they can complete online when the boss isn’t looking. No license fees, no per-person cost!!!</p>

		<h3>On-demand customized forms </h3>
		<p>Create a form to collect the information you need. Collect any type of information you want - ask your participants their favorite color, favorite 80’s hair band, or how they take their coffee. It’s not our place to tell you what information you need, so we leave it up to you to gather any data points you’ll need to successfully manage your group. Forms are free to make, free to use, free to customize!</p>

		<h3>Take Payment Immediately </h3>
		<p>Scratch off yet another line from your to-do list by making payments part of the online registration process. Groups and activities that require fees, club dues, or tuition can now take online payments immediately. No more chasing registration checks around town and hoping to get to the bank before it closes! Take credit card payments in person or online, or scan e-checks and have them deposited to your account immediately.</p>

		<h3>Keep accurate records </h3>
		<p>Keeping manilla folders of registration forms, waivers, sizes, uniform requests, payments made, outstanding invoices and rosters is a little too old school - not to mention messy and not exactly secure. Wouldn’t it be easier on you to have them all in one place, stored in the cloud, accessible from anywhere? </p>
