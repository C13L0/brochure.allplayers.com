		<h3>Registration available 24/7 </h3>
		<p>parents have busy schedules, they can’t always get in to a facility to fill out paperwork and write a check. Take away that sense of dread of having to skip their lunch break to stand in line to register their kids and send them a link they complete online when the boss isn’t looking instead. No license fees, no per-person cost!!!</p>

		<h3>Take Payment Immediately </h3>
		<p>for groups and activities that require fees, club dues or tuition, payment can be taken as part of the registration process, scratching off yet another line item from your to-do list. None of us like to chase registration checks around town and hope we can get to the bank before it closes to make that deposit. Take credit card payments in person or online, or scan e-checks and have them deposited immediately. </p>

		<h3>Keep accurate records </h3>
		<p>keeping manilla folders of registration forms, waivers, sizes, uniform requests, payments made, outstanding invoices and rosters is a little too old school, not to mention messy and not exactly secure. Wouldn’t it be easier on you to have them all in one place, stored in the cloud, accessible from anywhere?</p>
