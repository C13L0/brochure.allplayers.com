Designate certain roles for certain people. Create a shared calendar and schedule meetings, events, and activities. Send out communications on a whim to all or some of your participants. Create apparel or merchandise with your group’s logo or design and hear the cash register roar. Use whatever you like, we give you the framework, you build it the way you want it. </p>
