<h3>It’s as easy as:</h3>
<ul class="content">
	<li>1. Create Your Group</li>
	<li>2. Add/Invite Participants</li>
	<li>3. Use as many features as you need</li>
</ul>

<p>AllPlayers.com has such a deep suite of features ranging from communication and scheduling to online payments and custom store that you’re sure to have all the tools you need to successfully manage a group - whether you have ten participants or a thousand. </p>

<p>1. Create Your Group is as easy as coming up with a creative name, establishing a home base for your group and deciding on the colors and features you’ll use. You’ll be creating a custom web page for your specific need, to do with what you want. </p>

<p>2. Adding Participants to your newly formed group can be done a few ways: send an email to your invitees with the details to your group (we’ll provide that email) or import an existing list.  You can also make registration for your group available to the public to generate new membership!</p>

<p>3. Features, features, everywhere! As a group creator, you can choose to use as many of the features as you want. Open up online registration for instant and easy enrollment. Take online payments. Designate certain roles for certain people. Create a shared calendar and schedule meetings, events, and activities. Send out communications on a whim to all or some of your participants. Create apparel or merchandise with your group’s logo or design and hear the cash register roar. Use whatever you like, we give you the framework, you build it the way you want it. </p>
