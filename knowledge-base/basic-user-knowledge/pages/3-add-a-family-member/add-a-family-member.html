		<p>Once you have created your AllPlayers.com account, you will want to add your family members so that you can easily share your photos, calendars and important information. You may also need to register your child for a group on AllPlayers.com. For example, your local recreation center may host spring soccer for children, and you want to register your child for the league.</p>

		<p>As a parent/guardian for your child on AllPlayers.com, events from your child's group will automatically display in your own calendar, and you'll receive messages from the group. You'll always have easy access to your family's activities through AllPlayers.com!</p>

		<div class="alert-box">
			<p>If you're registering your child for a group on AllPlayers.com, you will automatically be added as a guardian to the group, so you can receive updates and view the group's event in your calendar.</p>
		</div>
		<p>There are three methods to add a family member to your account:</p>
		<ul class="content">
