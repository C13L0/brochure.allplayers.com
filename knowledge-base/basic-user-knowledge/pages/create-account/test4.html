		<p>You can add your spouse/co-guardian to your account at AllPlayers.com through your home page. A co-guardian is any adult that should have guardian privileges for your child's account. If your spouse/co-guardian already has an AllPlayers.com account, you can invite them to become a guardian for your child.</p>

		<p>Since the account for the spouse/co-guardian provides guardian privileges to your children's accounts, you should create and link your children's accounts before adding your spouse/co-guardian.</p>

		<p>To add a spouse/co-guardian to your account:</p>

		<p>Click the AllPlayers.com logo or Home button at the top of any page to go to your home page.</p>

		<p>On your home page, find the Family box. Click Add Family at the bottom, then select Add Spouse/co-guardian from the drop-down menu.</p>

		<p>If you do not have children linked to your account, you will not be able to create an account for your spouse/co-guardian. To create an account for your child, follow the instructions here.</p>

		<p>Select which child or children your spouse/co-guardian should have guardian access for.</p>

		<p>Complete the form with your spouse/co-guardian's information.</p>

		<p>Click Create new account.</p>

		<p>You will receive confirmation that your spouse/co-guardian's account has been created. Your spouse/co-guardian will now appear in your Family box and your Friends box on your Home page.</p>
