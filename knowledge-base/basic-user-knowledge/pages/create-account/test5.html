		<p>You can add your children to your account at AllPlayers.com from your home page. When your child has an AllPlayers.com account that is linked to your account, you can easily register your child for a group on AllPlayers.com.</p>

<p>As your child's parent/guardian at AllPlayers.com, you are able to monitor your child's activities on AllPlayers.com. You will automatically be added as a guardian to any group your child joins, so you can receive updates and view group events in your calendar.</p>

<h4>To add a child to your account:</h4>

<p>Click the AllPlayers.com logo or Home button at the top of any page to go to your home page.</p>

<p>On your home page, find the Family box. Click Add Family at the bottom, then select Add Child from the drop-down menu.</p>

<p>Complete the form with your child's information, then click Create new account.</p>

<p>NOTE: If your child does not have his own email address, check the box to use an AllPlayers.net email address. Mail intended for your child will be forwarded to your email address.</p>

<p>You will receive confirmation that your child's account has been created. Your child will now appear in your Family box and your Friends box on your Home page.</p>
