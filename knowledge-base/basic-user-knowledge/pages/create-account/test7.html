		<p>Guardians of children aged 13 and under have the ability to Act on behalf of their children to control what features are available to their children, including viewing friends and messages.</p>

		<p>Click the AllPlayers.com logo or Home button at the top of any page to go to your home page.</p>
		<p>In the Family box on your home page, you have multiple options for editing your child's information.</p>

		<p>To update your child's My Information page, click edit next to their name.</p>

		<p>To update other information on your child's account, you will need to login as your child.</p>

		<p>To do this, either log out of your account and login with your child's information, or use the shortcut Act on behalf on your child's profile page. To access your child's profile, click on your child's name in the Family box on your home page.</p>

		<p>You do not need to login as your child to register them for a group or to make a payment on your child's account.</p>

		<p>On your child's profile page, find the box labeled User Control and click Act on behalf of this user.</p>

		<p>When you click Act on behalf of this user, you are taken to your child's home page.</p>

		<p>Update all of the information that you need to update on your child's account.</p>

		<p>Once you have finished acting on behalf of your child, don't forget to log out and log back in with your own account information.</p>
