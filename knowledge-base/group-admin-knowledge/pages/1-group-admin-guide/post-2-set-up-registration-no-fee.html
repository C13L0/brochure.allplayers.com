		<p>Once you have created your group at AllPlayers.com, you'll want members to join your group!</p>

		<p>To allow people to join your group, you will need to enable registration. With AllPlayers.com, you can have free group registration, or you can require that members pay a fee to join the group.</p>

		<p>In this section, we will focus on enabling registration for a group that does not require fees to join.</p>

		<p>While there are many ways to set up registration for leagues and teams, in this example, we will enable registration for teams in our <a href="#">sample organization</a> to allow players, parents and fans to join a team.</p>

				<li><b>Registration Form:</b> If your group needs to collect data from your members as they register for your group, you can <i>Add a Registration</i> Form to request this information. If your group is related to other groups that already have registration forms, you can choose a preexisting form.</li>
				<li><b>Minimum/Maximum Age:</b> If a role is age-restricted, choose you minimum and maximum ages. <i>TIP: If your league allows players to "play up" to the next age level, ensure that your minimum age is set to allow younger players to join the group</i>.</li>
				<li><b>Gender Requirement:</b> Restrict your role to allow only males or females in a given role (for example, players in a girls' basketball league) if necessary.</li>
				<li><b>Registration Limit:</b> If a maximum number of people are allowed in a role, enter that number. <i>Example: enter 10 for Player role if only 10 players are allowed on a team; enter 1 for Coach role if only one coach is allowed per team.</i</li>
				<li><b>Direct Role Registration URL:</b> This link is automatically generated; you should not alter this link.</li>
				<li><b>Hidden registration for [role]:</b> If you do not want to show a role on your registration page for your group, check this box.

				<li><b>Enable challenge code for [role]:</b> If you only want certain people to register for a specific role in your group, enable the challenge code and enter a code of your choice. Provide this code to a user to restrict registration to only those who know the code. <i>Example: if you want to only allow people who you have cleared to be a coach to assume the Coach role, set a challenge code for that role. Provide the challenge code to your coaches so that only they can join the group in the Coach role</i>.</li>
