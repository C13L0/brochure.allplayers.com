<div class="row">

  <h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
  <p>As a group admin, you may want to provide your users with a custom domain to use to visit your AllPlayers.com group page.</p>
  <hr />

  <h3>Set up forwarding</h3>
  <p>In order to set up a custom domain name to use with your AllPlayers.com group page, you will need to use a domain provider. Each provider will handle domain forwarding differently, so it is important to follow their instructions on how to forward your domain.</p>
  <hr />

  <h3> Masking</h3>
  <p>Depending on your chosen domain provider, you may have the option to use Masking. Masking will allow you to display your custom domain name in the address bar instead of your AllPlayers.com group page address.</p>
