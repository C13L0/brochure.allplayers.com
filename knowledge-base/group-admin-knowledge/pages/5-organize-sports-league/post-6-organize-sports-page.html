		<p>AllPlayers.com provides all the tools you need to organize and manage your sports league.</p>

		<p>With AllPlayers.com, you can set up leagues, divisions and teams, then automatically create your season schedules. Your coaches will be able to administer their own team pages, where members can share photos, carry on conversations to set up carpools, snack schedules and more. You and your coaches will easily be able to communicate events like rainouts and cancellations using our broadcast messaging tools.</p>

		<p>Before we set up our sports league, it's important to understand the basic concepts of <b>Groups Above</b> and <b>Groups Below (Subgroups)</b>.</p>
		<img src="images/knowledge/group-chart-org.png">
		<p>In this illustration, Springfield Recreation Center is the main group above. Each subgroup below the main organization may also have additional subgroups.</p>

		<p>For example, the 10-year-old 2011 Boys Winter Basketball League has a group above of 2011 Boys Basketball (which contains all age divisions), and six groups below (subgroups), each team in the division.</p>

		<p>Organizing your groups as illustrated above allows you to easily maintain your groups not only for the current season, but for future and past (archived) seasons.</p>

			<p>We recommend building a chart similar to the illustration above if you are organizing sports leagues for an organization. It's a great way to stay organized and maintain your league and team pages moving forward through new sports seasons.</p>
