			<p>As a group administrator, you can add registration forms for any or all of the roles associated with your group. These forms will be presented to your members during the group registration process. You can create unique registration forms for each role if you need to collect different information. For example, your registration form for coaches might ask for different information than your registration form for players.</p>
