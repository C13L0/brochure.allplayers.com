			<p>For a sports league, naming your league, divisions and teams may require some thought before you create your groups on AllPlayers.com.</p>

			<p>Visitors can search AllPlayers.com to find groups in their area that offer activities. For that reason, we suggest that you have one main group for your organization, and build subgroups under your main group to features your leagues and/or programs.</p>

		<h3>Identify your organization in search terms</h3>
		<div class="six columns">
			<p>When you create your <b>Subgroups</b>, we recommend including your main organization's name in the <b>Search Terms</b> field for your group. This will help visitors easily identify leagues, divisions and teams that are a part of your organization.</p>

			<p>For example, there may be dozens of groups on AllPlayers.com named "Youth Basketball" or "U12." When you identify your organization in the <b>Search Terms</b> field, your organization's name will appear along with your subgroup's name in a user's list of their groups, as well as in the search results for groups on AllPlayers.com.</p>

		<h3>Include coach name in team name</h3>
		<div class="twelve columns">
			<p>Many sports teams use common names. For example, did you know that Eagles, Bears, Wildcats and Tigers are among the most popular team nicknames? Your league may have teams with these very names. Another possibility is that you may have a team named "Eagles" in every age division in your league.</p>

			<p>We recommend including the coach's name in your team name. This method offers three advantages:</p>

			<ul class="content">
				<li>If more than one team in your league has the same name, including the coach's name will make the team's group name unique;</li>
				<li>If a team that you create is new and does not yet have a name, including the coach's name will easily identify the unnamed team; and</li>
				<li>If the coach's name is included in the group's name, it creates an identifier that can help you easily identify coach scheduling conflicts at a glance when you review game schedules.</li></ul>
