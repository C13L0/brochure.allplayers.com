<p><em>Industry Leaders Join Forces to Offer Groups of All Sizes the Absolute Best Options for Schedule Management</em></p>
<p> Irving-based AllPlayers.com, the first application built to make life easier for mom and dad to register and manage all of their children’s activities using one secure and simple account, today announced a newly-formed partnership with QuickScores.com, the leading provider of online sports league scheduling. This partnership will integrate QuickScores’ scheduling system within the AllPlayers.com suite of services, enabling groups of all sizes to easily create schedules for leagues, tournaments, fields, resources and more. </p>
<p>With this partnership, current AllPlayers.com customers will continue to enjoy free access to all the group management and social elements, such as mobile, text, email, multimedia and file sharing in addition to advanced scheduling options provided by QuickScores. Likewise, current QuickScores customers will now have the option to utilize the free AllPlayers.com group management features in companion to the scheduling features they’ve become accustomed to.</p>
<p>“We are all about making everything easy on the parent or participant and the group administrator,” said AllPlayers.com President and CEO Jason McKay. “Many of our customers have utilized QuickScores for the robust scheduling solution it has provided for years.

This bundling partnership is win/win for our users. They get the best of what the two companies have to offer.”</p>
