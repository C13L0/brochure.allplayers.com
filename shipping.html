<h4>Delivery Method and Timing</h4>

<p>All transactions that do not involve shipping of goods, such as sports registration fees, fundraising sponsorships and donations, and other payments for services, submitted before 8 PM CT will be authorized and processed the same day.  Those submitted after 8 PM CT will be processed on the next day.</p>

<p>For purchases that involve shipping, there are two factors that impact when you will receive your order: the time it takes for the product to leave the warehouse, and the time it takes for your order to be shipped by the chosen carrier. All orders for in-stock merchandise that are placed prior to 5pm CT, Monday through Friday, will begin order processing and fulfillment that same day. All orders for in-stock merchandise placed after 5pm on Friday, or on Saturday or Sunday, will begin processing on the next business day. After your order leaves our warehouse, the time it takes the chosen carrier to deliver your order will depend on the type of shipping service you have selected. Here is summary of typical shipping times for the three levels of shipping service we offer:</p>

<p><b>Standard:</b> Orders shipped with Standard Service within the 48 contiguous states will arrive 3-6 business days after the order leaves our warehouse.</p>

<p><b>Expedited:</b> Orders shipped with Expedited Service (including AK and HI) will arrive 2-4 business days after the order leaves our warehouse.</p>

<p><b>International shipping:</b> Orders shipped to Canada will arrive in 8-16 business days after the order leaves our warehouse.</p></p>
